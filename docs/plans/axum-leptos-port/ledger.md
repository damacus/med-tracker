# Axum and Leptos port ledger

Plan: `docs/plans/axum-leptos-port/plan.md`

Planning baseline: `781c3a297ffe24ae5b70f893d55b568eab1216fc`.

## Decisions

- Observable behaviour parity replaces one-for-one RSpec translation.
- Existing accounts and medical data survive cutover; reauthentication is
  acceptable.
- Combined application-process target is under 200 MB; PostgreSQL and
  supporting services are excluded.
- API tests precede broad UI parity tests; product implementation follows both
  baselines except the bounded Leptos foundation ruling below.

Ruling: start one isolated Leptos SSR login-page foundation before the full
API and browser baselines close — the user explicitly requested an early UI
start with an expected-red Rust smoke — the cost if wrong is reworking the
shell when shared API, router, and authentication interfaces are settled.
This does not count as UI, PWA, or workflow parity.

| Owner | Exclusive paths | Reserved shared paths |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API contract writers | Their separate worktrees; `rust/contract-tests/**`, `rust/parity-matrix.md`, API fixture and contract-task changes | No `rust/web/**` edits |
| Leptos foundation writer | Separate worktree and branch; `rust/web/**` only | No root workspace/lockfile, shared router, database/schema, API fixtures, parity matrix, or contract runner edits |
| Coordinator | Plan, ledger, serial integration and combined checks | Root workspace/router/API integration after UI review |

Record each accepted task as `Task N: complete (commits BASE..HEAD, review
clean)` and each unresolved decision as `Ruling: decision — evidence — cost if
wrong`. Do not mark a task complete from a test run without its independent
review and recorded result.
