# I18n Epic Progress - med-tracker-b45f

## Current Plan (PR < 200 lines)
1. Set up basic i18n configuration
2. Create locale files for en, cy, es, pt
3. Identify ~10 hardcoded strings in views/components
4. Replace with t() calls and add translations
5. Add basic tests for i18n setup

## Focus Areas for First PR
- Views and components (most visible impact)
- Common UI strings (buttons, labels, navigation)
- Establish translation pattern for future PRs

## Next Steps
- grep for hardcoded strings in app/views/
- grep for hardcoded strings in app/components/
- Set up config/locales/ structure
