# MedTracker - Coding Agent Progress

## Latest Session: December 2, 2025 (Security Headers & Scanners)

### Summary
Implemented security headers and verified security scanning tools.
All tests pass: 492 examples, 0 failures, 13 pending.
Reduced failing features from 81 to 73.

### Changes Made
1. **config/initializers/security_headers.rb**: New initializer for Permissions-Policy header
2. **Gemfile**: Added bundler-audit gem for dependency vulnerability scanning
3. **features/security.json**: Marked 8 security features as passing

### Security Features Verified/Implemented
- SEC-016: HSTS header (configured via force_ssl in production)
- SEC-017: X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN (Rails default)
- SEC-018: X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff (Rails default)
- SEC-019: Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin (Rails default)
- SEC-020: Permissions-Policy (newly implemented - disables geolocation, camera, microphone)
- SEC-029: Brakeman security scanner passes with 0 warnings

- SEC-031: No secrets committed to source control (verified)

### Security Status
- Security features: 23/42 passing (was 8/42)

### Next Steps
1. Implement account lockout (SEC-007) - requires Rodauth lockout feature + migration
2. Implement rate limiting (SEC-010) - requires Rack::Attack gem
3. Enable Content-Security-Policy (SEC-009/SEC-033) - requires careful configuration

## Previous Session: November 28, 2025 (CARER-010 Implementation)

### Summary
Implemented CARER-010: Capacity validation requires carer for patients without capacity.
All 10 carer_relationships features now pass.

### Changes Made
1. **app/models/person.rb**: Added `carer_required_when_lacking_capacity` validation
2. **app/views/people/_form.html.erb**: Added person_type and has_capacity fields with helpful hints
3. **app/controllers/people_controller.rb**: Added person_type and has_capacity to permitted params

6. **features/carer_relationships.json**: Marked CARER-010 as passing
7. **docker-compose.dev.yml**: Added command to start Rails server

### Validation Logic
- Person with `has_capacity: false` must have at least one carer assigned
- Validation checks `carer_relationships.any?` to allow building relationships before save
- Error message: "A person without capacity must have at least one carer assigned"

### Test Results
- 456 examples, 0 failures, 13 pending
- All carer_relationships features: 10/10 passing

## Previous Session: November 28, 2025 (Rodauth Signup Implementation)

4. User created with correct role (parent/minor based on age)
5. Verification email sent
6. User can login immediately (7-day grace period in non-production)

### Features Completed
- AUTH-006: Rodauth signup form creates account and person ✓
- AUTH-008: Email verification grace period in non-production ✓

### Remaining Authentication Features
- AUTH-007: Email verification required in production (needs production testing)
- AUTH-009: Google OAuth creates new account
- AUTH-010: Google OAuth links to existing account

2. **db/seeds.rb**: Added `:carer_relationships` to fixture loading order
3. **app/services/spec_fixture_loader.rb**: Changed to load all fixtures at once to avoid PostgreSQL FK validation issues

### Authorization Verification Results

## Previous Session: November 28, 2025 (Initialization)

### Summary

This session adapted the initializer workflow for an existing mature Rails application.
MedTracker already had a complete project structure, Git repository, and extensive test suite.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Project Analysis
- Read and analyzed `docs/app_spec.txt` (685 lines of detailed specification)
- Reviewed existing documentation: `docs/design.md`, `README.md`, `agents.md`
- Analyzed implementation plans in `docs/plans/USER_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md`
- Assessed current test coverage in `spec/` directory

### 2. Created feature_list.json
- Created comprehensive feature list with 200 test cases
- Organized by area: authentication, authorization, prescriptions, dose_tracking,
  person_medicines, dashboard, admin, carer_relationships, audit, medicines,
  people, profile, security, navigation, style, accessibility, performance,
  i18n, pwa, e2e
- Marked passing features based on existing implementation status
- Each feature has unique ID, category, area, description, steps, and passes status

### 3. Created init.sh
- Environment setup script wrapping existing Taskfile commands
- Checks for required tools (docker, task)
- Starts development server via `task dev-up`
- Seeds database with fixtures via `task dev-seed`
- Displays test user credentials and useful commands

## Notes

- The project uses PostgreSQL 18 exclusively (no SQLite)
- All tests run in Docker via `task test`
- Development server via `task dev-up`
- Fixtures provide realistic test data
- TDD is mandatory - all production code requires failing tests first
