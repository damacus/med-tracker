## Previous Session: November 28, 2025 (Initialization)

### Summary

This session adapted the initializer workflow for an existing mature Rails application.
MedTracker already had a complete project structure, Git repository, and extensive test suite.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Project Analysis
- Read and analyzed `docs/app_spec.txt` (685 lines of detailed specification)
- Reviewed existing documentation: `docs/design.md`, `README.md`, `agents.md`
- Analyzed implementation plans in `docs/plans/USER_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md`
- Assessed current test coverage in `spec/` directory

### 2. Created feature_list.json
- Created comprehensive feature list with 200 test cases
- Organized by area: authentication, authorization, prescriptions, dose_tracking,
  person_medicines, dashboard, admin, carer_relationships, audit, medicines,
  people, profile, security, navigation, style, accessibility, performance,
  i18n, pwa, e2e
- Marked passing features based on existing implementation status
- Each feature has unique ID, category, area, description, steps, and passes status

### 3. Created init.sh
- Environment setup script wrapping existing Taskfile commands
- Checks for required tools (docker, task)
- Starts development server via `task dev-up`
- Seeds database with fixtures via `task dev-seed`

## Notes

- The project uses PostgreSQL 18 exclusively (no SQLite)
- All tests run in Docker via `task test`
- Development server via `task dev-up`
- Fixtures provide realistic test data
- TDD is mandatory - all production code requires failing tests first
