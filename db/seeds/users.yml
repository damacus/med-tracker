# Replace these placeholder emails with real addresses before running in production.

# This file is intentionally kept in the repository so it can be mounted as a
# k8s ConfigMap volume at /app/db/seeds/users.yml to override defaults.
#
# Running `rails db:seed` is idempotent: users with an existing Account or a
# pending invitation are skipped automatically.
