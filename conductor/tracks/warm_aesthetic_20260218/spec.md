# Specification: "Warm & Reassuring" Visual Aesthetic

## Objective
Evolve the MedTracker visual identity from its current "Pending" state to a "Warm & Reassuring" aesthetic using the **Nord** color palette and **Modern Serif** typography.

## User Persona Focus
- **Parents:** Who need a calm, trustworthy environment during stressful health management moments.

## Design Requirements
- **Color Palette:** Nord (Arctic Blues/Greys for stability, Aurora accents for warmth).
- **Typography:** Modern Serif (Trustworthy, reliable, high legibility).
- **Feel:** Empathetic, supportive, clean, and professional.
- **Key Elements:** Soft shadows, generous border radii, and subtle Aurora-toned highlights.

## Deliverables
- A standalone HTML "Design Gallery" featuring 10 distinct UI treatments/variations of the aesthetic.
- A final recommendation for Tailwind configuration (colors, fonts, shadows).
