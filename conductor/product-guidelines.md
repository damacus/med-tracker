## Interaction Principles
- **Mobile-First & One-Handed:** Design for the real world. Interfaces should be optimized for quick, one-handed use, acknowledging that parents are often multitasking while recording or checking doses.

## Notification Strategy
- **Gentle Reminders:** Notifications should be supportive and friendly. We remind users of upcoming doses in a way that feels helpful rather than intrusive, maintaining a calm and helpful presence.
