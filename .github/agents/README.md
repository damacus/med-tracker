# MedTracker GitHub Copilot Agents

This directory contains GitHub Copilot agent configurations for the
MedTracker project. These agents are specialized AI assistants that can
help with specific tasks.

## Available Agents

### Documentation Agent

**File:** `documentation.yml`

**Purpose:** Searches the codebase for opportunities to add or improve
documentation in mkdocs-compatible format.

**What it does:**

- Analyzes models, controllers, services, and policies for documentation
  gaps
- Generates markdown documentation following mkdocs standards
- Places documentation in the `docs/` directory
- Maintains consistency with existing documentation style
- Creates comprehensive guides for features, APIs, and data models

**When to use:**

- After adding new features or models
- When refactoring major components
- To document undocumented code
- To improve existing documentation
- When preparing for releases

**How to use:**

1. Invoke the agent through GitHub Copilot
2. Ask it to scan for documentation opportunities
3. Review and approve the generated documentation
4. The agent will create markdown files in the `docs/` directory

**Example prompts:**

- "Scan the codebase for documentation opportunities"
- "Document the Prescription model"
- "Create user guide for medication tracking"
- "Document the authorization policies"

## mkdocs Compatibility

All documentation generated by agents is compatible with mkdocs format:

- Standard markdown syntax
- Proper heading hierarchy (H1 > H2 > H3)
- Fenced code blocks with language identifiers
- Relative links between documents
- No HTML (unless necessary)
- Clean, readable structure

## Integration

The agents work with the existing documentation structure:

- `docs/design.md` - Application architecture and design
- `docs/user-management.md` - User and person management system
- Additional documentation as needed

## Adding New Agents

To add a new agent:

1. Create a new YAML file in this directory
2. Define the agent's name, description, and instructions
3. Specify the context files the agent should review
4. List the capabilities the agent needs
5. Update this README with the new agent's information

## Contributing

When creating or modifying agents:

- Follow YAML best practices
- Run `yamllint` to validate syntax
- Keep instructions clear and specific
- Test agents before committing
- Update documentation accordingly
